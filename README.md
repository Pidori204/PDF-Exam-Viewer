# PDF-Exam-Viewer
Will come handy for taking tests yourself with PDF-based exams!

This is a HTML-based project and lets you take exams from PDF-based exams, highlight questions, choose answers (with shortcuts available!), mark questions for later review. All exam datas are saved in the browser with "localStorage" method, matched with each PDF you view. 

Also you can save your answers and marks to a .csv file, that you can open via Excel (or Sheets, ..etc) and analyse your performance!

You can use this file directly via the below link:

Have fun!
